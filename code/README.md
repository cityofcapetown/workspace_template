# Code Folder

This is the folder where you should store all your code. Everything in this folder will be backed up to your parent git repository when you shut down this container. 

You should periodically back up this folder by executing 

```
git add -A
git commit -m "<Add a message here explaining your actions>"
git push origin master
```
