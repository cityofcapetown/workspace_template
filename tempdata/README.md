# Temporary Data Folder

This is where you temporarily store data that you're working with.

Anything in this folder will **not** be backed up to the git repository.

You should therefore expect that everything in this folder can be destroyed with no warning. Your code should contain everything required to pull your raw data from an **external** source and store it here temporarily.
